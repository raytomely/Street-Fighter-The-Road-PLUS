This is a port of an obscure korean beat 'em up game ,  it was developed for DOS,  luckily the source code was available.
I have ported it using the cross-platform library SDL so porting it to other platform should be easy.

the story is set in an apocalyptic future where criminals, thugs and delinquents roam the streets. so then came Ken, Guile and Iori and they decide to join forces and clean the world from that garbages.   

at the end of each stage you battle a boss of a well known fighthing game.

if you find the game too difficult to complete you can enable the "one punch man" mode in the "sfroadconfig.cfg" file like so: one_punch_man = 1

you can also remap the buttons configuration in that file,  and for a list of characters special moves read the "special_moves.txt" file.

enjoy.
